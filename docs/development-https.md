# Enabling HTTPS in Nuxt Development

This guide explains how to enable HTTPS for local development. HTTPS is required when connecting to StatusDB dev, which requires secure connections.

## Configure Nuxt for HTTPS

The Nuxt development server can be configured to use HTTPS by providing SSL/TLS certificates. We use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate locally-trusted certificates, which allows browsers to accept the HTTPS connection without security warnings.

### Prerequisites

Install `mkcert`, a tool for making locally-trusted development certificates:

#### macOS

```bash
brew install mkcert
brew install nss   # Required for Firefox support
```

#### Linux

```bash
sudo apt install libnss3-tools
# Then install mkcert from your package manager or build from source
```

### HTTPS Certificate setup steps

#### 1. Create and Trust a Local CA

Install mkcert's root certificate authority on your system. This allows browsers to trust certificates generated by mkcert:

```bash
mkcert -install
```

This command:

- Creates a local certificate authority (CA)
- Installs it in your system's trust store
- Allows browsers to trust certificates signed by this CA

#### 2. Generate Certificates for Localhost

Generate SSL certificates for localhost and common local IP addresses:

```bash
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

This produces two files:

- `localhost.pem` - The certificate file
- `localhost-key.pem` - The private key file

#### 3. Move Certificates to a permanent Location

Create a directory to store your certificates and move them there:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/certs
mv localhost.pem localhost-key.pem ~/certs/
```

**Note:** You can use any directory you prefer. Just make sure to use absolute paths in the next step.

#### 4. Set File Permissions

Secure the private key file by restricting access:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/certs/localhost-key.pem
```

This ensures only you can read the private key, which is important for security.

#### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Add the certificate paths to your `.env` file using **absolute paths**:

```bash
LOCALHOST_HTTPS_KEY=/Users/yourusername/certs/localhost-key.pem
LOCALHOST_HTTPS_CERT=/Users/yourusername/certs/localhost.pem
```

**Important:**

- Use absolute paths
- Replace `yourusername` with your actual username

Once configured, Nuxt will automatically detect the environment variables and enable HTTPS. The Nuxt configuration in `nuxt.config.ts` automatically enables HTTPS when both `LOCALHOST_HTTPS_KEY` and `LOCALHOST_HTTPS_CERT` environment variables are set:

```typescript
...(process.env.LOCALHOST_HTTPS_KEY && process.env.LOCALHOST_HTTPS_CERT ? {
  devServer: {
    https: {
      key: process.env.LOCALHOST_HTTPS_KEY,
      cert: process.env.LOCALHOST_HTTPS_CERT
    }
  }
} : {}),
```

The server will then start on `https://localhost:3000` instead of `http://localhost:3000`.

#### 6. Start the development mode with `pnpm dev-https` instead of `dev`

Use the dedicated `dev-https` script which also sets up Node.js to trust the mkcert CA:

```bash
pnpm dev-https
```
instead of

This script:

- Exports `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to point to mkcert's root CA
- Ensures Node.js trusts certificates signed by mkcert
- Starts the development server with HTTPS enabled

#### Additional notes

- The certificates are valid for localhost and 127.0.0.1 only
- These certificates should **never** be committed to version control
- If you need certificates for other domains or IPs, add them to the `mkcert` command: `mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 example.local`
- To revoke trust, run `mkcert -uninstall` (this removes the CA from your system's trust store)

### Troubleshooting

#### Browser Shows Security Warning

If your browser still shows a security warning:

- Ensure `mkcert -install` was run successfully
- Try restarting your browser
- Check that the certificate files exist at the specified paths

#### Certificate Not Found Error

If you see errors about missing certificate files:

- Verify the paths in your `.env` file are absolute and correct
- Check that the certificate files exist at those paths
- Ensure you have read permissions on the certificate files

#### Node.js Doesn't Trust the Certificate

If Node.js (used by the server) doesn't trust the certificate: `unable to verify the first certificate; if the root CA is installed locally, try running Node.js with --use-system-ca`:

- Use the `pnpm dev-https` script which sets `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`
- Or manually export the variable: `export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem"`
