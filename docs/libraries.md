# Libraries and dependencies

## Core

This project is built using those major technologies:

- **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, known for its reactivity system and component-based architecture
- **[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)**: A web development framwork based on Vue to create performant and production-grade full-stack web apps and websites. It provides features like server-side rendering, automatic routing, and enhanced performance optimizations.

## User interface

### Styles

- **[UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/)**: An atomic CSS engine that offers instant on-demand atomic CSS generation. It is heavily inspired by Tailwind CSS, but ships with [several improvements](https://unocss.dev/guide/why#tailwind-css) like an [Attributify mode](https://unocss.dev/presets/attributify#attributify-mode) or better handling of icons and webfonts. We load the [wind4 preset](https://unocss.dev/presets/wind4) to achieve maximum compatibility with components styled with Tailwind.
